LiftOff Project Outline
Overview
The idea for my project is based around food trucks. Many people love them and spend time tracking them to see where they will be next, 
or search the internet looking for new ones to visit. I personally stumbled upon an event called Food Truck Friday in Tower Grove Park in
which over a dozen food trucks of different types are lined up on a couple of roads for customers to enjoy. I loved this event because it 
was a way to sample food from multiple trucks, figure out what I liked and which food trucks I might want to look for in the future. I 
actually began to search for a few online, but gave up compiling a list with locations and descriptions of trucks because it was too 
inconvenient. There are also plenty of people who eat lunch purchased from a food truck, or who may able to sample food from a truck in 
their area, and they want to find out when that food truck will be in that location again. Therefore, there needs to be an app for people
to gain knowledge of when certain food trucks will be at a certain location, or what other food trucks could be near them that they would
possibly like, if that food truck has a schedule, and how they can keep track of this information.

With my app, users will be able to see a list of food trucks in the Greater St. Louis  Area of different types. They will also be able to
make lists of food trucks they like, or may want to visit. Additionally, they will be able to see where the food trucks are located and 
group them by location or type of food. A calendar will also be available for a user to see when a food truck will be at a location. 
STLFoodTruckFavorites offers a place where people can find their favorite food trucks, where they will be in the future, and when they 
will be there so they can always be on top of their food truck favorites.

Features
User accounts: users will be able to log on and create an account that saves their food truck favorites/lists
Google Maps Integration: users will be able to click on a food truck location and see the address marked on a Google map
Search: users will be able to search for a food truck by type of food and location

Technologies
C# /.NET
MVC Model
Web API
JavaScript/JQuery
Bootstrap
Entity Framework

What I’ll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to set up an admin and user roles, user accounts, how to integrate Google Maps API with my web app. I would 
also like to include JavaScript and possibly JQuery to add some more advanced functionality, along with Bootstrap.
